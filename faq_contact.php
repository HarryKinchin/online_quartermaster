            <h4>How is my data protected?</h4>
        </button>
        <div class="accordion-content">
            <p>Your data is protected using a combination of technical and administrative measures designed to keep it safe.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Passwords:</strong> Your password is never stored in plain text. Instead, we use a process called <strong>hashing</strong> and <strong>salting</strong> to turn your password into a long string of random characters that cannot be reversed. This means that even in the unlikely event of a data breach, your actual password remains unreadable. </li>
                <li><strong>Data Encryption:</strong> All data transmitted between your browser and our servers is encrypted using <strong>SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security)</strong>. This creates a secure, encrypted connection that protects your information from being intercepted while in transit.</li>
                <li><strong>Access Control:</strong> Access to your personal data is restricted to authorized personnel only, and their access is strictly limited to what is necessary to perform their jobs.</li>
            </ul>
